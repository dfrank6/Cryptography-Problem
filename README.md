# HackGT8-Problem

This is a cryptography problem that was written to be solved by participants in the Capture the Flag tournament at HackGT8 Hackathon hosted at Georgia Tech on October 22-24, 2021.

After exploring different potential cryptography techniques, I decided that XOR encryption would be fun yet challenging to implement and solve.

I also had fun coming up with the "flag" (the solution) as well as providing a clever hint as to what the key was! It was solved by 24 hackers at the event :)
