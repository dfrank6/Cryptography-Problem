# HackGT8-Problem

I wrote this problem to be solved by participants in the Capture the Flag tournament at HackGT8 Hackathon hosted at Georgia Tech on October 22-24, 2021.

I would say it is medium difficulty because one needs to know what and how to perform bitwise operations as well as how to convert to ASCII in practice.

I provided a clever hint in the problem text as to what the key was!

It was solved by 24 people :)
